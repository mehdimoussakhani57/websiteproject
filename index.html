<p><h2> <strong>The Following</strong> is an assignment carried out by myself, part of the Code Nation Digital introduction course. 
    Having spent 20 years in electrical and electronics industry - working in such diverse areas as engineering in alarms and fire alarms
    , electrical, surveillence cctv, telecom and network digital video recording and remote viewing, I was introduced to Code Nation through
    my job advisor at the job centre plus. I felt that completing a coding course at this stage when I already have been using a raspberry pi for around three years
    would be right for me. I hope you'll like the websight.</h2></p>
