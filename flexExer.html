                    <h1>UNIT 1</h1>
<p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</p><br>
<p>Information technology is a vital and integral part of every business plan. IT use is in :
Communication, eg: email, video conferencing.
Data management, eg: digital versions of files and documents on servers with immediate access.
Management information systems, eg: data is used for planning, tracking sales data and profitability.
Customer relationship management, eg: using IT to change and improve customer relations and respond to customers needs
   forthwith.</p><br>
</div>

<div class="three">
<p>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</p><br>


<p>Skills , Methods and Resources combine to achieve success in digital projects.<br>
Strategy which is identifying the challenges you face;
	      also looking at where the competition is form part of the skills necessary for sucessful completion of digital projects.<br>
	      Realising how customer habits are changing can place you in an advantageous position viz a vie your competitors.
There are two main resources that you will need to make your digital venture a successful one.<br> First the people and culture of innovation to sustain competitive advantage.
Secondly you need the right technology and communication devices to give you the means by which it is delivered.</p><br>

</div>

<div class = "four">
<p>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</p><br>


<p>To plan a website I think first of content. This could be your homepage.
	On this page you should make an impact, who are you and what do youdo.<br>
There will be a products page and aservices page respectively.
Your clients should be able to find out more about your products and also contact you should they wish.
You will therefore need an about us page and a contact us page.<br>

You will also need to consider cost of the website, eg: domain name - the address of your website.<br>
website hosting - where your web sight will live.</p><br>

<div class = "two">

<p>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</p><br>


<p>Digitalisation itself is changing economic fundamentals, what it means to compete and industry dynamics. The speed and magnitude of digital disruption is unprecedented. Profitability will change radically and advancements in data analytics and connectivity create new insights and new business models. Incumbents are disadvantaged compared to new movers.</p><br></div>


<div class = "three">
<p>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</p><br>

<p>To ensure that you will get the solution you really need by setting clear objectives. Check the licensing agreements and fees, and will you have to pay for support and maintenance. Will your chosen supplier help you when things go wrong and the compatibility of hardware and software is also very important.</p><br>


<p>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</p><br></div>


<div class = "four">
<p>With Trellor you first create a team and then boards under that team and subsequently you create lists under the boards and cards under the lists. Git on the other hand coordinates work between multiple developers by tracking every change made on the system. Github is a remote repository that you can push your local repository onto.</p><br>

<p>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects</p><br>

<p>GDPR is about data subjects. All individuals data resides in the database, eg : your CV or your prescription. The individual has a right to ask an organisation to reveal what this data is and how it is treated. If requested, you must block and or delete all the data in question. The requests are made much more frequently now than in the past.</p><br>
	
</div>

<div class = "two">

	<p>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual</p><br>


<p>Using visual studio gives the opportunity of writing code, whether it is html or javascript or css and running it in the same environment without having to download any other software. This saves a lot of time and accelerates learning. If, however , there comes a time when you discover a quicker way of doing the same things, you would use the new software.</p><br>


<p>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</p><br></div>

<div class = "three">
<p>As with every other walk of life there must be comparable methods and packages similar to VS and Trello, but using visual studio and trello has been extremely useful in writing , running and saving your software. There is provision to access your</p><br>
files, post them to git and subsequently to github repositories. Visual studio put you directly onto the terminal command and you can drag and drop folders in it to edit files. Trello allows you to put into perspective to do lists. These include to do, doing and done lists.

<p>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</p><br>


<p>I think a good website should only serve the purpose of delivering the intended outcome I.e promotion of ideas and products and attracting viewers and clients. However, it would be very useful to have links in your web sight and have all text and pictures in proportion as well as a page for reviews and comments.</p><br></div>


<div class = "four">
<p>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</p><br>

<p>I would like to set a background image and create anchors to enable visitors to the website to move along the page by jumping and not scrolling. It would be ideal to have a database of all who visit the sight and question them about what made them visit my website, eg: word of mouth or word search.</p><br>

<p>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose<p><br>
</div>

<div class="two">
<p>I have created a home page which walks though the visitor to clicking a link which will navigate him/her to the main web page. From here it is a simple matter of scrolling to see other pages. The content of the page is my work in conjunction with online sources. Where appropriate I have submitted relavant links. I have used a whole host of tools including slack, trello, kanban, and macbook.</p>
</div>

<div class = "three">
<p>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</p><br>

<p>Teamwork is the key to greater efficiency and time saving. If it takes one year to finish a project for 150 software developers, it will take one developer 150 years to finish the same project. One drawback that exists as far as IT tools are concerned is that they prevent developers from thinking aloud, which would be a plus.</p><br>


<p>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</p><br>
</div>

<div class = "four">
<p>I would encourage teamwork from the outset and only ask developers to partial code the project, I.e: write single task code and  integrate all the software when everyone has finished all their code. I would also set up online question and answer on the website to quick respond to customer questions.</p><br>

<p>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</p><br></div>

<div class = "two">

<p>I would facilitate downloading of apps on any device or software the potential customer may have. The use of plain English is also a must in a world where people of all ages and backgrounds visit websites, there is plenty to confuse the web sight visitor, let alone the use of <br>
	unnecessarily long winded and complicated vocabulary<br></p>

<p>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</p><br>
</div>


<div class = "three">
<p>You want ease of use , accessibility, usability and performance and you require validation for cross browser functionality, performance, security and user experience. You must also be agile with new technology while manoeuvring across different platforms. It is obvious that the likelihood of errors occurring will increase. Using emulators to create similar digital environments is one way of improving performance.</p><br></div>


<div class = "four">

                 <h1>UNIT 2</h1>       

<p> 1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</p><br>

<p>
	On page one- which is the home page, there is a simple message about the website. There is also a link which will navigate the visitor to the main website. Here, it is a simple scrolling that will bring about further content for the website visitors viewing. There is naturally some CSS content and techniques which reside in a separate file within the same folder intended to make the website more visually interesting and stimulating.
</p>
</div>






<div class="two">
<p> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</p><br>

<p> If you post content that you have created there is no adverse copyright clause affecting your website. If you post content created by others, you could find yourself in legal wrangling if you failed to obtain permission from the copyright holder. If the permission to use is perpetual you can use it time and again. Also check to see if the permission to use is transferable.</p><br>
</div>


<div class = "three">
<p> 1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that<br>


 people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome<br>
 them</p><br>

<p> People with disabilities acquire the same information as able bodied. Fortunately computers can convert text into speech. The content of the website must be perceivable, operable ie: you should be able to interact with it, understandable and robust ie: accessible. Paying attention to structure, reading order, keyboard and links is important.</p><br>
</div>

<div class = "four">
<p> 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</p><br>

<p> Bmp, jpg, png and gif. Bmp is not ideal for websites. Jif is an 8 bit, 256 colour format which may be enough for what you require. Jpg supports compression and so it is ideal for use on the web, unlike bmp which does not support compression. Png is also a good choice for use on the web. </p><br>
